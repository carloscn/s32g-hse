The application project for S32R45 CM7_0 core.

The following modification should be done in the project after attachment of
S32 SDK for S32R45 EAR 0.8.0 to already created project:

1. Add options to Project Setting
   Go to "Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Tool Settings"
   Select "Standard S32DS C Compiler->Preprocessor"
   Set "Defined symbols (-D)" options:
        - START_SECONDARY_CORES
        - TURN_ON_CPU1 if the project for CM7_1 core is created
        - TURN_ON_CPU2 if the project for CM7_2 core is created

2. Change S32 Debugger launch configuration
    Go to "Debug Configurations"
    Select "S32 Debugger-><project_name>_M7_0_<Debug/Release>_RAM_S32Debug_Load_<ELF/symbols>"
    Change "Run Commands" in Startup tab to the following commands:

set *0x382A0000 = 0x342A0000
set *0x382A0004 = 0x382A0025
set *0x382A0024 = 0xFFFEF7FF
set *0x38540000 = 0x34540000
set *0x38540004 = 0x38540025
set *0x38540024 = 0xFFFEF7FF
c

Values from commands above are compatible with SDK code.
If address of Reset Handler or value of Stack Top are changed in SDK code,
values in "Run Commands" should be changed accordingly.

VDK usage note: 
The application created with S32 SDK for S32R45 EAR 0.8.0 is not compatible with vpconfig provided by DS.
